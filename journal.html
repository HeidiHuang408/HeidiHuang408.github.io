    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
    <q>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</q>
    <p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, </p>
    <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
